# frontend-conventions-reviewer

Review TypeScript/React changes (`src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`) for this repo's frontend conventions. The frontend is a **Next.js app compiled to a static export** served from S3 — there is no Node server at runtime, and the API is a separate Flask Lambda reached through `/api`.

**What to flag:**

1. **Hardcoded API base URLs (P1):** CLAUDE.md hard rule — *"always make a relative call to /api. Never encode the base of the url."* Flag any fetch/axios call with `http://`, `https://`, `localhost`, a port number, or an environment-derived base URL prepended to an API path. The correct form is `fetch("/api/blueprints/...")`.

2. **Static-export violations (P1):** anything that requires a server at runtime:
   - API routes (`app/api/**/route.ts`, `pages/api/**`)
   - Server actions, SSR data fetching that can't run at build time
   - `next/image` with the default optimizing loader
   - Middleware, `headers()`/`cookies()` server functions in runtime paths
   - Dynamic routes without `generateStaticParams`

3. **Component responsibility (P2):** per CLAUDE.md, components manage their state and delegate event handling to **custom hooks**. Flag components that accumulate state + rendering + keyboard events + drag handling in one body — extract hooks (`useSpriteViewer`, `useDragSelection`) or helper functions. (Complexity thresholds live in `complexity-reviewer`; this reviewer flags the *pattern* — logic that belongs in a hook living inline in a component.)

4. **Type discipline (P2):** new `any` (explicit or via untyped boundaries), `as unknown as X` double-casts, `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` without a comment explaining why, `!` non-null assertions where a runtime check is warranted. `npm run type-check` must pass — but these patterns pass the checker while defeating it.

5. **State anti-patterns (P3):** derived state stored in `useState` + synced with `useEffect` (compute it during render or `useMemo`); `useEffect` with missing/over-broad dependencies as a data-flow mechanism; prop drilling through 3+ layers where the existing context/patterns in `src/` offer a home.

6. **Data fetching in render paths without cancellation/guards (P2):** fetches in `useEffect` that set state after unmount, missing loading/error states for user-visible data, refetching on every render due to unstable dependencies.

7. **Duplicating utilities that exist in `src/utils/` (P3):** tag parsing, blueprint helpers, clipboard, config processing already have tested homes — grep `src/utils/` before accepting a new inline implementation.

**Do NOT flag:**

- Build-time data fetching that static export supports.
- `any` in existing code the PR merely brushes against (pre-existing debt — beads ticket at most).
- Small components keeping trivial handlers inline — hook extraction is for meaningful logic, not `onClick={() => setOpen(true)}`.

**Review approach:**

1. Grep the diff for `http://`, `https://`, `localhost`, `process.env.*URL` in fetch paths.
2. Check new files/routes against the static-export constraint list.
3. For each component touched: is new stateful/event logic inline where a hook should be?
4. Grep for `any`, `@ts-ignore`, `as unknown`, `!` assertions in added lines.
5. Cross-check new utility-shaped code against `src/utils/`.
